Notes for QA work on adder project.

Plan:
- Confirm test framework and cases with PM.
- Add unit + CLI tests covering ints/decimals/negatives/large/invalid.
- Run tests and report.

Open questions:
- Should inputs like 'NaN' or 'Infinity' be accepted? Current parser (Decimal) would allow them; likely we should reject.
- Any locale-specific formats (e.g., commas) to support? Default: no.
