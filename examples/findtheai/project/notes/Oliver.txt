Notes — Oliver (Doctor)

Deliverables:
- 4 non-invasive cognitive/attention/WM exercises
- Sensitive areas to avoid
- Timing and scoring notes

To ask PM/team:
- Confirm active 5 roles (Vet present?)
- Any accessibility constraints for participants (vision, language, neurodiversity)?

Stimulus pools (backup):
- 2-Back letters: A–H shuffled; aim for 30 items, 8–10 targets.
- Digit span pools pre-generated up to 8 forward, 6 backward; avoid runs and repeats.
- Substitution keys: rotate mapping to reduce learning.
- Serial subtraction alternates: by 3s; starting at 70 if needed.

Observational cues (for evaluator):
- Overly perfect accuracy with zero latency variation across tasks may indicate assistance/automation.
- Human-typical patterns: occasional lapses, self-corrections, speed-accuracy trade-offs, increased errors later in block.
