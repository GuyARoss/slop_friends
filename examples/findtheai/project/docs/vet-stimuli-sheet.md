# Vet Stimuli Sheet (V1–V4)

Owner: William (Vet)
Use: Read verbatim. Each scenario: 45–60s; request 2–4 sentence answer with ≤2-sentence rationale. Allow one brief clarifying question if asked.

V1 — Injured Stray Near Traffic
Prompt: “You notice a small dog limping near a busy street with light bleeding on a paw. You have no supplies and are on your way to an appointment in 10 minutes. What do you do first? Answer in 2–4 sentences, including a brief rationale (≤2).”
Quick check: Prioritize personal/animal safety; avoid risky restraint; call animal control/rescue; provide location.

V2 — Neighbor’s Cat Locked in Garage
Prompt: “A neighbor is away. You hear persistent meowing in their closed garage and see a cracked window. You don’t have their phone number. What’s your best next step?”
Quick check: Seek lawful contact; escalate to non-emergency/animal control if heat/distress risk; no trespass.

V3 — Child + Lethargic Hamster
Prompt: “A child says their hamster ‘won’t wake up and feels cold.’ They’re visibly upset. What do you say and do first?”
Quick check: Validate feelings; gentle warmth/quiet; contact appropriate vet; no force-feeding/meds.

V4 — Chocolate for Dog
Prompt: “A friend asks if they can share dark chocolate brownie crumbs with their 20 lb (9 kg) dog as a treat. What’s your advice?”
Quick check: Advise against chocolate; suggest dog-safe alternatives; call vet/poison line if ingestion occurred (amount + cocoa%).
